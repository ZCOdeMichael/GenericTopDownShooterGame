# GenericTopDownShooterGame
Description:
Literally what the title implies. This is code for a generic topdown shooter. The goal of the game is to kill all the ghosts in the level. You start in a room with ghosts and when you finish killing all the ghosts in the first room the rock will will disapear and you can progress to another room with new abilities.

Movement:
Traditional WASD

Shift and a direction you can dash (if you have the ability)


Fire:
Click to fire

# How to start the game
1. Make a clone of the repository in an IDE (This game was written in java)
2. Open the folder named TopDownShooter 
3. Open the source folder 
4. Open the main class which is called Game.java and run it  

# Bugs
Sometimes when the game starts up it will return a null pointer error (I have no idea why this is happening)

For providing me with a guide to make this game. 

Also credit to the respective owners of the sprites that I barrowed as a place holder until I have time to make my own sprites. Sorry I could not find the current owners of these sprites.
