Description:
This a topdown shoot 'em up game. The goal of this game is to kill all the ghosts in the level. You start in a room with ghosts and when you finish killing all the ghosts in your current room the passage to the next room will become available and you will recieve new abilities.

Movement:
* Traditional WASD
* [Shift+(WASD)]Shift and a direction type [WASD] you can dash (if you have the ability)

Fire:
* Click to fire

# How to start the game
1. Make a clone of the repository in eclipse 
2. Open the folder named TopDownShooter 
3. Open the source folder 
4. Open the main class which is called Game.java and run it  

# Bugs
* Sometimes when the game starts up it will return a null pointer error and crash (I have no idea why this is happening)
* Can glitch out of the map if the player spams the dash ability

For providing me with a guide to make this game. 

Also credit to the respective owners of the sprites that I borrowed as a place holder until I have time to make my own sprites. Sorry I could not find the current owners of these sprites.

In addition thank you to Lumpman2 who helped with the bullet mechanics.
